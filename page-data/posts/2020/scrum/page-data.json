In our case Scrum.\\nScrum is an agile framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products. Scrum embodies a set of practices termed ceremonies.\\nIn summary, the Scrum team's project is managed in small iterations to continuously improve the product and the team. This model encourages teams to \", mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"experiment and find ways that work best\"), \" for them and achieve the team's goals more efficiently.\"), mdx(\"hr\", null), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Why is it beautiful?\\nMany millennials like myself aspire to be in a workplace that is empowering and gives us a voice to speak up rather than following instructions rigidly. This agile principle works well with it. As we have seen, the Agile principle emphasizes interaction and people rather than processes and tools. Exercising this principle allows team members to delve deep into each other's tasks and questions and give suggestions. This drives interaction among the team and aids in increasing morale and improves work satisfaction.\\nIn addition, the fact that agile is an iterative way of running a project allows teams to start in a clean slate after every iteration. Why is this beneficial? Most often than not, teams find it hard for them to find a definite way of doing things and it requires a lot of trial and error and collection of feedback from stakeholders and clients before finding the right fit. This agile principle allows teams to do just that by making a hypothesis, trying it out in an iteration, and evaluating if the result coincides with the hypothesis at the end of the sprint iteration. If it does, then the team has found the right solution, otherwise, they could move on to another hypothesis. This flexibility allows the team to make better decisions.\\nAs we can see, the above shows some of the ways how agile principles bring about better team workflow in delivering results by allowing team involvement and allowing the team to fail and try again. This has also revamped the way projects are run in contrast to the past where the waterfall principle (following a rigid timeline, fixed processes, and tool) was practiced.\"), mdx(\"h2\", null, \"Understand the purpose of Scrum ceremonies\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Lastly, I would like to describe the ceremonies that the Scrum team does to execute the agile principles explained in the second part of the article above and also explain the purpose behind them.\"), mdx(\"h3\", null, \"Sprint planning (First day of the\\xA0sprint)\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"It is a planning session whereby the team comes together to \", mdx(\"strong\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"understand the sprint goal and plan their work allocation.\"), \"\\nThe purpose is to serve as a collaboration session between the Product Owner and the team on the best way to achieve the sprint goal.
